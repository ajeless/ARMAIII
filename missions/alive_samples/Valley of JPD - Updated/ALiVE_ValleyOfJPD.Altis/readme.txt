						Valley of JPD | ALiVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This mission features a 3 faction battle in a valley on Altis. It demonstrates the raw power of ALiVE when only needing about 5 minutes to place all of the modules, markers, and units. Each side
will attempt to overrun the other. The Military Logistics module insures that both sides will be reinforced when their unit counts are low and thus the battle will rage on.
